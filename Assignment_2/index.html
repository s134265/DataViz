                        Part 1: Telling Data Stories
                    </h3>
                    <h4>What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</h4>
                    The oxford english dictionary defines a narrative as:
                    <blockquote>“An account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections
                        between them.” </blockquote>
                    Essentially, it is a representation of a story where the representation is the order of which the events are related.
                    <h4>What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.</h4>
                    I enjoyed the visualization of
                    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/02/us/politics/20100201-budget-porcupine-graphic.html">
                        Budget Forecasts, Compared With Reality</a> by the New York Times. First of all, the visualization
                    guides the observer through the narrative using six slides. Each slide represents an important point
                    for the narrative, and keeps the observer interested. The graph is kept simple, and very consistent in
                    style and coloring. Compared to the other visualizations in the paper, it represents a manageable amount
                    of data, and hides the remaining data for the user to explore. Finally, the use of annotations is kept
                    to a bare minimum, but the ones provided helps explaining key points in the timeline.
                    <h4>What's the point of Figure 7?</h4>
                    Figure 7 presents an analysis of the design space of narrative visualization. This is useful for identifying recurring elements
                    in different visualizations, and categorizing these design features. The figure gives a complete overview
                    of the genres, visual narrative and narrative structures of all analysed visualizations. From the figure,
                    a clear distinction between each visualization can be made using these different patterns.
                    <h4>Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and
                        Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting',
                        etc).
                    </h4>
                    <h4>Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3. What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</h4>
                    <h4>What is your least favorite genre? Why?</h4>
