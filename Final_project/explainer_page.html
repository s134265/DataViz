                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    Being accused or suspected on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion is neither fun nor legal. Unfortunately, the practice
                    of
                    <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/racial-profiling-definition" title="racial profiling: definition">racial profiling</a> has been an increasingly popular term in the U.S. In 2015,
                    <a href="http://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/austin-police-monitor-wants-more-done-to-prevent-racial-profiling_20180227105309592/994782265">1,134 people in Austin, TX</a> filed complaints related to racial profiling by local enforcement. And the problems persists; in 2017
                    <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-gives-a-green-light-to-racial-profiling_us_59509915e4b0c85b96c65ac5">The state of Texas</a> passed a bill, commanding all police officers to search anyone who "looks like
                    an immigrant". In this project we examine relationships between geographic occurences of traffic stops
                    by Austin law enforcement and demographics of certain zip-codes to find patterns of racial profiling.
                    This way, we can tell whether you are more likely to get profiled in certain parts of town than others,
                    based on your race.
                    <h3>What are our datasets?</h3>
                    As a response to the public outcry, the city of Austin yearly releases
                    <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2016-racial-profiling-dataset-arrests">
                        data for motor vehicle stops that results in a citation or arrest</a>. The 2016 data includes 9185
                    stops, and information about factors such as location, race time, etc. The three most important attributes
                    are described below:
                    <p>
                        <table style="width: 100%">
                            <tr>
                                <th>Attribute</th>
                                <th>Description</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> APD_RACE_DESC</td>
                                <td> Race of suspect</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> RACE_KNOWN</td>
                                <td> Was race known by officer before stop?</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> X_COORDINATE, Y_COORDINATE</td>
                                <td> Coordinates for stop location in
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Plane_Coordinate_System">State Plane Coordinate System</a>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </p>
                    To compare the traffic stop data with demographics for a given area, we use the
                    <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2014-housing-market-analysis-data-by-zip-code">
                        2014 Housing Market Analysis Data by Zip Code</a>, also for Austin. The housing market data contains a lot of socio-econmic factors (disability ratio, ratio below poverty level, unemployment rate etc.) and ethnical distribution per zip code of 32 zip codes (and therefore not all).

                    <h3>Why we chose the datasets</h3>
                    <p>
                        These two datasets combined gives an overall impression of where the majority of arrest in Austin takes place, and perhaps
                        why. Demographics is an important factor when analyzing crime data, but can also tell whether there
                        are discrepancies in the number of arrest of specific races in the area. Since both datasets can
                        be directly coded to zip-codes of Austin, they may assist each other.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the goal for the end user's experience? </h3>
                    <p> The user should follow the narrative from the introductory exploratory data visualizations to the conclusion
                        and its corresponding explanatory visualization. By making our visualizations interactive, we hope
                        to encourage the user to explore the data and come to his or her own conclusions. The user should
                        find it easy and accessible to explore the data and get the information he or her needs. Furthermore,
                        this information should be presented in a credible manner, and give valuable insights. After going
                        through our visualizations, the user should feel more knowledgeable about racial profiling incidents
                        in Austin, which races are especially exposed, and where incidents are most likely to occur.</p>
                    <h2>Basic stats</h2>
                    <h3>Write about choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</h3>
                    <p>The State Plane Coordinates had to be converted through finding their FIBS code, converting lengths into correct measures (american yards uuugh) and then preprocess in Python through a Google maps API to convert every observation to Lat/Lon. <br/> 
                    The race index had to be made as well by counting observations by zip code in whites and non whites to extract how their distributions compared to the total arrested in the zip code was. <br/> 
                    The principal component analysis of the housing data had the following structure (all other features are omitted due to low weightings):

                    You should write (just briefly) which group member was the main responsible for which elements of the assignment. (I want
                    you guys to understand every part of the assignment, but usually there is someone who took lead role
                    on certain portions of the work. Thatâ€™s what you should explain).
