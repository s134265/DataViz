                    Being accused or suspected on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion is neither fun nor legal. Unfortunately, the practice
                    of
                    <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/racial-profiling-definition" title="racial profiling: definition">racial profiling</a> has been an increasingly popular term in the U.S. In 2015,
                    <a href="http://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/austin-police-monitor-wants-more-done-to-prevent-racial-profiling_20180227105309592/994782265">1,134 people in Austin, TX</a> filed complaints related to racial profiling by local enforcement. And
                    the problems persists; in 2017
                    <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-gives-a-green-light-to-racial-profiling_us_59509915e4b0c85b96c65ac5">The state of Texas</a> passed a bill, commanding all police officers to search anyone who "looks like
                    an immigrant". In this project we examine relationships between geographic occurences of traffic stops
                    by Austin law enforcement and demographics of certain zip-codes to find patterns of racial profiling.
                    This way, we can tell whether you are more likely to get profiled in certain parts of town than others,
                    based on your race.

                Traffic stops, visualized
            </h3>
            Let's take a look at all traffic stops occured in each zip-area. Below in the left pane is an interactive map of Austin.
            The map is subdivided into zip-codes with colors indicating total number of stops in each area. Obviously, the
            most interesting areas are the ones with higher stop frequencies, but feel free to check out the more "rural"
            areas too. Clicking on a zip-area centers the selected area in the right pane. Here, each stop is visualized
            with a dot. When an area is selected, the bar chart below changes accordingly, and shows the proportions of each
            race stopped in the area. The colors on the bar chart indicates whether the officer on duty knew or didn't knew
            the suspects race before stop. You can also hover above each bar to see excactly how many stops it accounts for.
            Try it out!

            <ul>
                <li>In some areas, the distribtions of race are roughly equal between black, hispanics and whites.</li>
                <li>In others such as <button class="updateZip" value="78703">78703</button>, more than 70% of all stops are of white people</li>
                <li>Downtown areas such as 
                    <button class="updateZip" value="78721">78721</button>, 
                    <button class="updateZip" value="78702">78702</button> and
                    <button class="updateZip" value="78723">78723</button> 
                </li>
                has a higher proportion of blacks stopped than the other areas.
                <li>Suburban areas has fewer arrests than downtown, which isn't really surprising considering the higher traffic downtown.</li>
